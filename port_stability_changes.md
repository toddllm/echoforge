# EchoForge Port Stability Improvements

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Port Cleanup in `stop_server.sh`
- Added a dedicated `release_port_8765()` function that specifically targets processes using port 8765
- Implemented fallback mechanisms using different command-line tools (lsof, ss) to ensure port detection works in various environments
- Added a wait period after port cleanup to ensure socket TIME_WAIT states are properly handled

### 2. Modified Port Selection Logic in `run.py`
- Updated the `find_available_port` function to wait for the preferred port (8765) instead of incrementing to the next port
- This ensures consistent port usage, which is essential for stable application URLs

### 3. Environment Variable Configuration
- The server now properly respects the PORT environment variable, allowing consistent port specification

## Testing
- Verified that the server consistently starts on port 8765 after the changes
- Confirmed proper cleanup of processes using port 8765 when shutting down the server
- Server responds properly on port 8765 as expected

## Benefits
- Consistent URL for users (always http://localhost:8765)
- More reliable server startup sequence
- Easier integration with external tools and tests
- Elimination of port conflicts between restarts

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring server stability during regular operation
- Conduct thorough user testing with the stable port
- Update documentation to reference the stable port consistently
