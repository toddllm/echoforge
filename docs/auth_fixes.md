# Authentication and Styling Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes made to the authentication system and UI styling in the EchoForge application.

## Authentication Fixes

### Login Endpoint
- Fixed indentation errors in the login function in `app/api/auth_routes.py`
- Implemented proper session cookie handling for user authentication
- Added secure cookie settings to maintain user sessions

### Logout Endpoint
- Enhanced the logout endpoint to properly clear session cookies
- Improved redirect handling after logout

### Known Issues
- Session state is not fully maintained when redirecting with `?next=/dashboard` parameter
- This will require additional fixes to the authentication middleware

## Styling Improvements

### Login and Signup Forms
- Created a comprehensive `auth.css` file with modern styling
- Implemented floating label inputs for a cleaner look
- Added proper form validation styling
- Improved button states including loading indicators
- Made the forms responsive and visually consistent

### Visual Enhancements
- Added subtle gradients and shadows for depth
- Improved color scheme with consistent brand colors
- Added animated loading states for buttons

## Future Improvements
- Fix the session state maintenance issue with the `next` parameter
- Implement remember me functionality
- Add more robust error handling for authentication failures
- Enhance password reset functionality

## Testing
The authentication system has been tested with the default credentials:
- Username: `echoforge`
- Password: (default password)

Login, signup, and reset password forms are working correctly with the new styling.
