## Current Issues

1. ✅ Dashboard lacks proper user name display
2. ⏳ Theme persistence across pages and between sessions
3. ❌ Voice generation errors in characters showcase

   - Update the dashboard route to extract user's first name from session
   - Properly handle auth_required return values

2. 🔄 Character showcase template conversion
   - ✅ Create Jinja2 template from static HTML
   - 🔄 Update routes to use the template
   - 🔄 Test template with authentication integration

3. 🔄 Theme persistence implementation
   - ✅ Add theme_preference to user profile model
   - 🔄 Create database migration for theme_preference column
   - ❌ Test migration success
   - ❌ Update profile form to allow theme selection
   - ❌ Verify theme persistence across pages

### Phase 2: Error Handling & Stability (Next)

1. ❌ Voice generation error investigation
   - Identify root cause of voice generation errors

## Implementation Notes

### Current Progress

- The dashboard page now properly displays the user's first name
- A template for the character showcase has been created
- Database model has been updated to support theme preference

### Next Steps

1. Run the database migration to add theme_preference column
2. Verify the user profile updates work with the theme preference
3. Test the character showcase template with proper authentication

### Testing Protocol

Before marking any task as complete:
1. Test the feature in isolation
2. Test the feature in context with related features
3. Make sure no regressions have been introduced
