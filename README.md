   ```

#### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/echoforge.git
   cd echoforge
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:

### Development Workflow

We use the following tools to ensure code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **Flake8**: Linting
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **pytest**: Testing

Run the linting and formatting checks with:

```bash
make lint
```

Automatically format the code with:

```bash
make format
```

Run tests with:

```bash
make test
```

### Using Make

The project includes a Makefile with common development tasks:

- `make setup`: Install development dependencies
- `make test`: Run the test suite
- `make lint`: Run code quality checks
- `make format`: Format code automatically
- `make build`: Build Docker containers
- `make run`: Run the application with Docker Compose
- `make clean`: Clean up temporary files and containers
